# PHP function to display the time as an event a while ago

The date is converted to a timestamp using Carbon, so that the timing of an event can be known from a period of how many minutes, hours, months, or years in a simple and beautiful way.

The function can be used like that:
timeago('2023-06-13 14:00:00'); // OUTPUT -> Since 2 Days
